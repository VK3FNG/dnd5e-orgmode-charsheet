# dnd5e-orgmode-charsheet
This is an Emacs org-mode character sheet with automatically calculated derived attributes. Pretty HTML stolen from https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes.

Please note this is an early version while I learn org-mode tables. Please feel free to submit patches or fork this project.
